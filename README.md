## Pre-requisite
  - aws account
  - basics of terraform and jenkins

    
## Completion steps →
  - Step 1 → Setup Terraform and configure aws on your local machine
  - Step 2 → Building a simple Infrastructure from code using terraform
  - Step 3 → Setup Sonarqube and jenkins
  - Step 4 → ci-cd pipeline
  - Step5 →Monitering via Prmotheus and grafana
  - Step 6 → Terraform Destroy

## Step 1 → Setup Terraform and configure aws on your local machine
  1. **Setup Terraform**
     - To install terraform copy and paste the below commands
     ```
     sudo su
     snap install terraform --classic
      which terraform
     ```
  2.  **Configure aws**

      - Now it is ask to your access key and secret key for this open your csv file and paste the access and secret key and remain everything default
      - Now you are ready to configure aws from your terminal

 ## Step 2 → Building a simple Infrastructure from code using terraform
   1. go to folder → cd JENKINS-TF
   2. there are three files present main.tf, install_jenkins.sh , provider.tf
   3. open the file →vim Main.tf
   4. change this section → ami = # your ami id , key_name= #your key pair if any
      - Now run terraform commands →
      - main.tf includes userdata which links install_jenkins.sh file on which execution install jenkins,docker,trivy,and start the sonarqube container on port 9000
